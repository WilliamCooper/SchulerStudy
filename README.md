This project aims to improve the measurements of vertical wind from RAF aircraft by using the link between errors in ground-speed and in attitude angles to develop a correction to the pitch. The presentation used for talks about this is SchulerPresentation.pdf, generated by SchulerPresentation.Rnw or SchulerPresentation.lyx. Other components here are intended for inclusion in the document on WindUncertainty, a separate project.
